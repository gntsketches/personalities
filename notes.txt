LINTING 
  > might be worth just experimenting with eslint for a bit before u add prettier...


Simplistic framework

    ?? maybe what you want here is "register" - something that connects a certain value with state, and receives updates...?

    state management
    flexible render method (use a templating library)
    wrapper for listener assignment (to update state)
    trigger to render on state update (triggers?)


TODO babel experiment

*** MYSTERIES ****************************************************************************************
    - something added extra .js files alongside .ts files
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63422959/webpack-build-or-typescript-is-creating-js-files-right-in-my-src
        what's weird is that it doesn't do this on build
            not sure exactly when/why these files are created
        also maybe u didn't want to get rid of them
            tsconfig has "target": "es5", and it's interesting,
              eg ListTemplate.js used an iife
