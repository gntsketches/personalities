BUT DO YOU EVEN NEED BABEL?
  https://dev.to/mbeaudru/is-babel-still-relevant-for-typescript-projects-36a7
  tldr: maybe not but it's handly for some things
    probably wouldn't hurt to use it so you get familiar with it

    - something added extra .js files alongside .ts files
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63422959/webpack-build-or-typescript-is-creating-js-files-right-in-my-src
        what's weird is that it doesn't do this on build
            not sure exactly when/why these files are created
        also maybe u didn't want to get rid of them
            tsconfig has "target": "es5", and it's interesting,
              eg ListTemplate.js used an iife
