## Personalities 

This is a tool for exploring personality characteristics, inspired by
a popular role-playing game. You can try it online at:
[personalities.toneflow.io](https://personalities.toneflow.io/).

The code for this is provided as an example use case for a homemade Javascript UI library, 
"Foolsgold". You can find that project (and a brief tutorial) here:
